# Doudizhu
## Overview
This project is an implementation of a popular Chinese card game: Doudizhu. The game features easy-to-learn rules that are hard to master, requiring mathematical and strategic thinking as well as carefully planned execution.  
The game is played among three people with one pack of cards (54 count), including the two differentiated jokers. It starts with each player bidding for the "landlord" position. Those who lose the bid or do not bid enter the game as the "peasants" team competing against the landlord. For each player, the objective of the game is to be the first one to have no cards left.  
The game starts with the landlord. In each round, each player must be able to show a deck of a certain pattern following that of the last player in turn, while each card must be larger than each of the last player's. A player with no available cards to show will be skipped in the round. If both 2 other players are skipped for a pattern shown by a player, the game enters another round starting with that player.
